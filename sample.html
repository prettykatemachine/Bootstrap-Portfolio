                If Kate could think of anything clever to write
                about herself, this is where she would type it.
              </p>
              <p>
                By day, she is your neighborhood friendly IT
                Support gal. By night, she is a knowledge-hungry
                web development student who seeks the satisfaction
                of achieving her dream job. When Kate isn't helping
                people turn their computer off and on again, she
                enjoys a wide variety of activities. Her favortie
                colors are electric blue, hot pink, black, and
                sparkle. She has a deep love and appreciation of
                music, although she has absolutely no talent for
                creating it. She will happily listen to anything
                from Pantera to Patsy Cline - Nine Inch Nails is
                her favorite. The other screen Kate enjoys staring
                at is the television, gaining entertainment from
                shows like The Sopranos, Archer, and Arrested
                Development.
              </p>

                Kate grew up being known as Katie, and she still
                responds to it. As she aged, she noticed that
                others began calling her Kate, making her speculate
                that she's a Kate now? She grew up in Bloomington,
                Minnesota as the child of two nurses and has an
                older brother. As an early teenager, she spent an
                unreasonable amount of time on the computer, and
                that's how her love of web development began. She
                sought to emulate the anime fan sites she enjoyed
                visiting, dreaming that she too, one day, will reap
                the satisfaction of having people enjoy something
                she made all by herself.
              </p>
              <p>
                She has a busy and rewarding life nowadays, living
                in New Richmond, WI with her family. Her fiance
                keeps her sane with lots of coffee and giggles. Her
                daughter is currently ten years old and enjoys
                drawing cats. Speaking of cats, their cat is 18
                years old, and is the cutest creature in the
                universe. When the weather is decent, they enjoy
                spending time outside and going for hikes.
